HEROES ARE IMPORTANT. HEROES TELL US WHO WE WANT TO BE BUT WHEN THEY MADE THIS PARTICULAR HERO THEY DIDN'T GIVE HIM A GUN, THEY GAVE HIM A SCREWDRIVER TO FIX THINGS. THEY DIDN'T GIVE HIM A TANK OR A WARSHIP OR AN X-WING, THEY GAVE HIM A CALL BOX FROM WHICH YOU CAN CALL FOR HELP AND THEY DIDN'T GIVE HIM A SUPERPOWER OR A HEAT RAY, THEY GAVE HIM AN EXTRA HEART. AND THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY. THERE WILL NEVER COME A TIME WHEN WE DON'T NEED A HERO LIKE THE DOCTOR.
